    <a href="/">adamand.me</a> was built by Rehan Ali, a.k.a. Daddy, a.k.a. “stink bug”, for a Ruby on Rails project during <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thefirehoseproject.com/">The Firehose Project</a>. It’s a database of memorable quotes made by my son Adam, a 2 year old toddler with a particularly wry and sharply developed sense of humour.
