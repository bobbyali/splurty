This is the first site that I developed whilst doing (The Firehose Project)[http://www.firehoseproject.com], an online Ruby on Rails bootcamp. The tutorial was designed to produce (this "Splurty" quote generator site)[http://splurty.herokuapp.com]. My final product is (this site that generates quotes from my son)[http://adamand.me].

The second project I developed for the bootcamp can be found (here)[https://github.com/bobbyali/nomster].
